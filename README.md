# Trinacia Backend

This project has the code of my first startup. The company failed because of the strenghted regulation applied to Facebook by the U.S government, which made it impossible to optimize campaigns by searching segmentation parameters because Facebook had to manually aprove each campaign segmentation change (it was impossible to propertly use the genetic algorith that I developed to solve this problem).
